        The current version of Wine contains a partial implementation of dwrite.dll
        which may cause text rendering issues in applications such as Steam.
        We recommend that you run winecfg, add an override for dwrite in the
        Libraries tab, and edit the override mode to "disable".

        Starting with wine 1.5.22 the new experimental Mac driver by CodeWeavers has
        been included in the main distribution. This allows wine to run without X11
        on MacOS X. To enable it execute the following command in your wine prefix:

          wine regedit #{prefix/'winemac.key'}

        To disable it execute:

          wine regedit /D 'HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Wine\\Drivers'
      EOS
