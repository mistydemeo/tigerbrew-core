    A "distutils.cfg" has been written to:
      #{distutils}
    specifying the install-scripts folder as:
      #{scripts_folder}

    If you install Python packages via "pypy setup.py install", easy_install_pypy,
    or pip_pypy, any provided scripts will go into the install-scripts folder
    above, so you may want to add it to your PATH *after* #{HOMEBREW_PREFIX}/bin
    so you don't overwrite tools from CPython.

    Setuptools and pip have been installed, so you can use easy_install_pypy and
    pip_pypy.
    To update setuptools and pip between pypy releases, run:
        #{scripts_folder}/pip install --upgrade setuptools

    See: https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/wiki/Homebrew-and-Python
