    A "distutils.cfg" has been written to:
      #{distutils}
    specifing the install-scripts folder as:
      #{scripts_folder}

    If you install Python packages via "pypy setup.py install", easy_install_pypy,
    pip_pypy, any provided scripts will go into the install-scripts folder above,
    so you may want to add it to your PATH *after* the `$(brew --prefix)/bin`
    so you don't overwrite tools from CPython.

    Setuptools has been installed, so easy_install is available.
    To update setuptools itself outside of Homebrew:
        #{scripts_folder}/easy_install pip
        #{scripts_folder}/pip install --upgrade setuptools
