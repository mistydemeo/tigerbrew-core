    A "distutils.cfg" has been written to:
      #{distutils}
    specifing the install-scripts folder as:
      #{scripts_folder}

    If you install Python packages via "pypy setup.py install", easy_install, pip,
    any provided scripts will go into the install-scripts folder above, so you may
    want to add it to your PATH.

    Distribute has been installed, so easy_install is available.
    To update distribute itself outside of Homebrew:
        #{scripts_folder}/easy_install pip
        #{scripts_folder}/pip install --upgrade distribute
