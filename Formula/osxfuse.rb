  def caveats; <<-EOS.undent
    If upgrading from a previous version of osxfuse, the previous kernel extension
    will need to be unloaded before installing the new version. First, check that
    no FUSE-based file systems are running:

      mount -t osxfusefs

    Unmount all FUSE file systems and then unload the kernel extension:

      sudo kextunload -b com.github.osxfuse.filesystems.osxfusefs

    The new osxfuse file system bundle needs to be installed by the root user:

      sudo /bin/cp -RfX #{opt_prefix}/Library/Filesystems/osxfusefs.fs /Library/Filesystems/
      sudo chmod +s /Library/Filesystems/osxfusefs.fs/Support/load_osxfusefs
    EOS
  end
end
