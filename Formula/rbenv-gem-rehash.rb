    If the GEM_PATH environment variable is undefined, rbenv-gem-rehash must
    first execute the gem env gempath command to retrieve RubyGems' default path
    so that it can can append to the path rather than override it. This can take
    a while--from a few hundred milliseconds on MRI to several seconds on
    JRuby--so the default path for the current Ruby version is cached to the
    filesystem the first time it is retrieved.
