      Mercurial is required to fetch its own repository, so there are now two
      installations of mercurial on this machine. If the previous installation
      was done via Homebrew, the old version may need to be cleaned up and new
      version linked:

        brew cleanup mercurial && brew link mercurial
      EOS
    end

    return s
  end

  def test
    system "#{bin}/hg", "debuginstall"
  end
