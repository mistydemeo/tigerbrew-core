    You will need to add:
      #{HOMEBREW_PREFIX}/bin/fish
    to /etc/shells. Run:
      chsh -s #{HOMEBREW_PREFIX}/bin/fish
    to make fish your default shell.

    If you are upgrading from an older version of fish, you should now run:
      killall fishd
    to terminate the outdated fish daemon.
