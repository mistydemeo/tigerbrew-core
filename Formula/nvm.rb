      Add NVM's working directory to your $HOME path (if it doesn't exist):

        mkdir ~/.nvm

      Add the following to $HOME/.bashrc, $HOME/.zshrc, or your shell's
      equivalent configuration file:

        export NVM_DIR=~/.nvm
        source $(brew --prefix nvm)/nvm.sh

      Type `nvm help` for further information.
